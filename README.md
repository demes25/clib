# clib
A general library for use in various c programs. Includes some basic array and hash structures, linear algebra, and PPM image processing.
(Currently, PPM processing is only available for hyper-specific formatting discussed further in the image.c file)

The static library file is precompiled as libl.a

This may then be easily linked using the argument -ll upon compilation.
